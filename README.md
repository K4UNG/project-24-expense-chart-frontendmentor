### What I learned

It's been quite a while since I last touched a line of code and this challenge helped me revise some of the core react concepts. This challenge was a bit unexpectedly hard but I managed to come up with a clean solution. I also added some animations and splitted the cash into 7 random amounts for some extra challenge. Overall, this was a really great challenge and I had a great time finishing it.

### Continued development

I will now continue my study plans as usual and I plan to dive deeper into react and learn a framework like Next in the upcoming days.
